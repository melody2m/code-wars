This kata was about capitalizing every other letter in a string.
This was easily accomplished using 'for' loops.
It could have also been done with other clever methods like creating 2 strings, one fully caps and one fully lowercase, and then referencing the correct indexes of each.
But I just used for loops to push into solution strings.
