This problem was interesting. You have to insert dashes in between odd numbers in a given set.
I began with trying to the array split and splice methods, but debugging proved difficult.
Eventually I solved the problem with help from Sean, (just treating the numbers as a string), whose solution we had pseudo-coded together the previous day.
